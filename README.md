- Deploy to custom 🔌 URL and Infrastructure 💿
- Track 🕵️‍♂️ each and every click on a 🔗 pckd, and retrieve

  - 🌐 IP address (Spoof-resistant)
  - 🕸️ ISP Name
  - 🗺️ IP-Location
  - 💻 Device details like OS Version and Device Model
  - 🪟 Browser Name and including version

  It's Just crazy how powerful it is! 🤯

- Edit links after they're created
- Custom Loading/Redirecting Screen 💯
- [On Roadmap!] Quick Redirections in 150ms! 😱
- Fast, Reliable and Secure 🔐
- Secret Storage 👮 and handling using 💻 environment variables

- Use your own DBMS 🥳. Pckd is compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and [many more](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/supported-databases)

This project was created to be the most powerful URL shortener for the public, so no wonder it's so feature-rich

<!-- Motivation -->

## 🤗 Motivation

After looking at all the `aka.ms` links out there which flood windows, along with the numerous time saving been prompted to buy premium plans from `bit.ly` while shortening my URLs, the decision of having a personal URL shortener hosted on a custom domain for free caught wind. Starting out by looking at GitHub for a JavaScript-based URL shortener, no one stood out and had minimal features. So, I decided to create my own URL shortener along with the help of a few friends, and got what this repository contains.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## 😲 Built With (Tech Stack)

The following technologies were involved in the making of this project.

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) ⚛️ - For the frontend of the app
- [Apollo GraphQL Server v3](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) 🕸️ - For querying the backend from the frontend efficiently
- [GraphQL Template By Mohit](https://github.com/Just-Moh-it/grapqhl-backend) 🧩 - Boilerplate Template used for initializing the backend
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) 💿 - The ORM used for the app
- Any 😨 relational or non-relational [database that Prisma supports](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/supported-databases)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) 🗺️ w/ [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - For handling states across the application

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

# 🤯 Quick Start Guide

To get started with having your own instance of Pckd, follow the steps described in the following section

_**NOTE**_: Here are the [**DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS**](docs/getting-started.md)

## 🌂 Prerequisites

You will need these to be already installed:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) 14+ and [NPM](https://npmjs.com/)
- [A supported database system](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/supported-databases)

And that's it

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## 💾 Installation

Follow these steps to get started with your own instance of Pckd

1. Clone the repo and `cd` to the folder base of this repo
2. Run command `npm run init` to install all the dependencies, and initialize environment files in both folders
3. Obtain a free API key from [IP Registry](https://ipregistry.co/) (for IP address tracking info lookups)
4. Create a database named pckd in your chosen DBMS and note down the connection Username and Password
5. Manually go to both the `client` and `server` folder and fill in the values in the `.env` file
6. Open the [`server/prisma/schema.prisma`](server/prisma/schema.prisma) file and replace `postgresql` with your chosen db name.
7. Return to base directory, and run `npm run db-init` to sync database with schema.
8. To test if everything's working, run `npm run dev` and test the app
9. To promote to production, run `npm run build-client` and then `npm start`

If you have any problems following the steps, [here are the detailed instructions](docs/getting-started.md)

# 🤩 Roadmap

This project is far from perfect, and we'll reach there one day, or at least get close.

- [x] Add forgotten password-reset capabilities ([issue #3](issues/3))
- [ ] Adding extra features such as enabling or disabling tracking on certain links ([Issue #2](issues/2))
- [ ] Quick redirects using ExpressJS directly from the backend, without loading react and Redux (planned ~150ms)
- [ ] Adding docker-compose supported quick installation

Known Issues:

- [ ] Hit not registered if IP not provided

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Just-Moh-it/Pckd/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
